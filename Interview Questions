4.	Community Cloud
      It allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations. It is a distributed system that is created by integrating the services of different clouds to address the specific needs of a 
      community, industry, or business. The infrastructure of the community could be shared between the organization which has shared concerns or tasks. It is generally managed by a third party or by the 
      combination of one or more organizations in the community.
   
Q.3 Service Model in Cloud ?
Answer : There is 3 types of Service models in Cloud.
         1.	Software as a Service [SaaS] -
                      Software as a service vendors host the applications, making them available to users via the internet. With SaaS, businesses don't have to install or download any software to their 
         existing IT infrastructures. SaaS ensures that users are always running the most up-to-date versions of the software. The SaaS provider handles maintenance and support.
         2.	Platform as a Service [PaaS] -
                      Platform as a service offers developers a platform for software development and deployment over the internet, enabling them to access up-to-date tools. PaaS delivers a framework 
         that developers can use to create customized applications. The organization or the PaaS cloud vendor manage the servers, storage and networking, while the developers manage the applications.
         3.	Infrastructure as a Service [IaaS] -
                      Infrastructure as a service is used by companies that don't want to maintain their own on-premises data centers. IaaS provides virtual computing resources over the Internet. The IaaS cloud vendor hosts 
          the infrastructure components that typically exist in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the hypervisor or virtualization layer.

Q.4 Architecture of Cloud Computing ?
Answer : Cloud Computing is the one of the demanding technology of current time. Which is providing Virtualized services as per demand. Starting from small to medium and medium to large,

Q.7 What is service ? & What are resources ?
Answer : There are various types of services available in AWS & in that services various types of resources.
         1. Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) for Identities of user and service
         2.Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for virtual server hosting,
         3.Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for scalable object storage
         4. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) for managed relational databases
         5.Amazon Lambda for serverless computing, and many others.
         Resource : Every service has its own resource to build and run your applications and infrastructure in the cloud. Each resource may have its own attributes, settings, and configurations that you can define based on your specific requirements.


IAM – Identity & Access Management -
Q.1 How many resources do we have in Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
Answer: The number of resources in Identity and Access Management (IAM) like User, Users groups, Roles , Access Policies,authentication methods, MFA. 

Q.2 Deployment model in Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
Answer: 1. On-Premises 
        2. Cloud-Based 
        3. Hybrid

Q.3 Identities in Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
Answer: Identities are the people or entities who are given permission to use an organization's resources. These can be employees, contractors, partners, customers, or anyone who needs access.
        Identities are usually represented by user accounts or profiles in the IAM system. Each identity has certain characteristics like a username, password, email address, and roles or permissions that 
        determine what they can do and what they can access.

Q.4 What is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) User?
Answer: A user is someone who interacts with a computer system or network. In IAM, an IAM user is an entity that represents a person or service that interacts with a system or network using login credentials 
        such as a username and password. IAM users are created and managed within an IAM system.

Q.5 What is the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Group?
Answer: In IAM, a group is a bunch of people who have similar attributes like roles, permissions, or access levels. Groups are used to make it easier to control and manage access to resources in an organization's IAM system. By putting people into groups, administrators can easily control who can access certain things based on their job, department, or other factors. For example, a company might 
        create a group for all the employees in the finance department, giving them specific permissions to use financial data and systems.

Q.6 What is the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Policy?
Answer: Policy is a set of rules that say what someone can do and what they can access in an organization's systems.IAM policies control and manage who can access resources based on their needs and roles. These rules can be set at different levels, like for individual users, groups, or specific resources. They say 
        what actions or permissions are allowed or not allowed for each person or group.

Q.7 What is the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Role?
Answer: Role is like a set of permissions that say what someone can do and what they can access in an organization's systems.
        IAM roles are used to give specific privileges and access levels to people based on their jobs or responsibilities. These roles can be customized to fit the organization's needs.
        When someone assumes a role, they automatically get the permissions that come with that role. This means they can do the things and access the resources defined in the role, without needing individual 
        permissions. IAM roles can be assigned to individual users, groups, or even to services.

Q.8 Where do we attach Identity Based Policy?
Answer: Identity-based policies are connected to individual users or groups in an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. These policies determine the specific permissions and access rights given to the 
        user or group.

Q.9 Where do we attach Resource Based Policy?
Answer: Resource-based policies are directly linked to the resources themselves in an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. These policies determine the permissions and access rights granted to entities 
        trying to access the resource.

Q.10 Can we be able to create Policy via JSON code?
Answer: Yes, it is possible to create policies using JSON code. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a commonly used format for representing structured data, including policy configurations.
        In an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system, you can create policies programmatically by constructing a JSON document that defines the desired permissions and access rights. 

Q.11 If one user has created it by default, which permission has been assigned to that user?
Answer: By default permission is IAM user chanage password.

Q. 12 What is dominator policy?
Answer: If user having less permissions but user adding in group & if group having full permission to that group (full access) in that case user having full access permission. 
        That kind of policy called as Dominator policy.

Q. 13 What is ARN? What are the fields in ARN?
Answer: ARN stands for Amazon Resource Name. It is a unique identifier assigned to resources in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem.
        ARN Fields are
        arn : <partition> :  <service_name> : <account_Id> : < user/admin>1.	arn:aws - This is a fixed string indicating that the identifier is an ARN associated with AWS.
        
Q. 14 How many types of ARN Partition?
Answer: ARN stands for Amazon Resource Name, which is used in AWS (Amazon Web Services) to identify resources uniquely. The ARN format helps in specifying a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, which aids 
        in permission policies and user activities.
        An ARN is structured as:
        arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id
        In this structure, "partition" is one of the components, and AWS currently has three main ARN partitions:
        aws: The standard partition for general AWS regions.
        aws-cn: The partition for China regions.
        aws-us-gov: The partition for AWS GovCloud (US) regions.
        These partitions help differentiate resources that reside in different geographic or regulatory boundaries.

Q. 15 What are Tags?
Answer: A tag is a label that you assign to a resource. A tag typically consists of a key-value pair, allowing you to categorize resources in various ways.

S3 [ Simple Storage Service]-
Q. 1 Difference between Block storage & Object Storage ?

Q.4 What is the major resource of S3 Bucket ?
Answer: Amazon S3 resources to which the policy applies include buckets, objects, jobs, and access points.The AWS::S3::Bucket resource creates an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region.

Q.5 Why do we need to host static websites instead of dynamic websites ?
Answer: Static websites are faster to create and publish, since they are less complex and don't need to be connected to databases of organized content.
        Static websites are a good choice for simple websites with fixed content that don't require frequent updates or user interactions. They are easy to create and maintain, cost-effective, 
        fast, secure, and scalable. However, if your website requires dynamic content or user interactions, a dynamic website with server-side scripting and a database may be a better choice.

Q.6 What is versioning & Why do we need versioning ?
Answer: Versioning refers to the practice of assigning unique identifiers or numbers to different iterations or releases of a software, application, or any other type of system. Each version represents a 
        distinct state of the system at a particular point in time.
        There are several reasons why versioning is important:
        1.Tracking changes
        2.Collaboration and teamwork: 
        3.Bug tracking and issue resolution

Q.3 What is an Amazon SNS function, and how we can configure it.
Answer: Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed messaging service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables you to send messages or notifications to a variety of endpoints, including email, SMS (text messages), mobile push notifications, and HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. SNS can be configured and used through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS SDKs.
       Here's an overview of how you can configure and use Amazon SNS:
       1. Creating a Topic: The first step in using SNS is to create a topic. A topic is a communication channel to which you can publish messages. You can create a topic using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. When creating a topic, you will provide a name and an optional display name.
       2. Subscribing Endpoints to the Topic: Once you have created a topic, you can subscribe endpoints to the topic to receive messages. Endpoints can include email addresses, phone numbers for SMS messages, mobile device tokens for push notifications, or HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. You can subscribe endpoints using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or programmatically through the AWS SDKs.
       3. Publishing Messages to the Topic: After creating a topic and subscribing endpoints to it, you can publish messages to the topic. Messages can be published using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or programmatically through the AWS SDKs. When publishing a message, you specify the topic to which the message should be sent and the content of the message.
       4. Configuring Message Attributes: SNS allows you to set message attributes such as message structure (JSON, raw text, etc.), message deduplication ID, message group ID, and more. These attributes can be configured when publishing messages to the topic.
5. Using SNS with AWS Services: SNS can be integrated with other AWS services. For example, you can configure an Amazon S3 bucket to send event notifications to an SNS topic, or you can use SNS to trigger AWS Lambda functions in response to messages.
6. Monitoring and Logging: SNS provides monitoring and logging capabilities, allowing you to track message deliveries, view message delivery status, and monitor the usage of SNS topics.
When configuring Amazon SNS, it's important to consider security best practices, such as setting appropriate access controls and permissions for topics and subscriptions, and enabling encryption for message delivery.
Overall, Amazon SNS is a powerful and versatile service for sending notifications and messages, and it can be configured and used through various AWS management interfaces and APIs to meet the messaging needs of your applications and systems.

Q.4 Difference between Amazon SNS & Amazon SQS.
ANS: 
     Amazon SNS :                                                                 
     1.SNS stands for Simple Notification Service
     2.SNS is a push-based delivery, i.e., messages are pushed to multiple subscribers.
     3.In SNS service, messages are pushed to the multiple receivers at the same time 
     4.SQS pushing pushed the messages to the subscribers immediately.
     Amazon SQS: 
     1.SQS stands for Simple Queue Service.
     2.SQS is a pull-based delivery, i.e., messages are not pushed to the receivers. Users have to pull the messages from the Queue.
     3.In SQS service, messages are not received by the multiple receivers at the same time.
     4.SQS polling introduces some latency in message delivery.Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) and Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) are both messaging services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although they have some similarities, they are designed for different use cases and have different characteristics. Here are some key differences between Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS:

Q.5 What are the different delivery formats and transports in AWS SNS?
ANS:  There are Two format available in  AWS SNS
     1) Delivery formats: Standard Format, Delivery Format.
     2) Transport In AWS : HTTP/HTTPS, Amazon SQS, Application,  Email/SMTP,Short Message Service, Lamda.Amazon Event Bridge.Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) supports several delivery formats and transports to accommodate various use cases and communication requirements. The different delivery formats and transports available in AWS SNS include:

Q.6 What is the difference between SNS FIFO & Standard while creating the SNS topic.
ANS: When creating an SNS (Simple Notification Service) topic in AWS, you have the option to choose between two types: Standard and FIFO (First-In-First-Out).

    SNS FIFO : 1. The FIFO Queue complements the standard Queue.
               2. It guarantees ordering, i.e The order in which they are sent is also received in the same order.
               3. A message is delivered once and remains available until the consumer processes and deletes it.

    Standard : 1. SQS offers a standard queue as the default queue type.
               2. It allows you to have an unlimited number of transactions per second.
               3. more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order.
 
Q.7 On which services are configured with the AWS SNS?
Answer: AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) can be configured to work with several other AWS services to facilitate the delivery of messages and notifications. 
        1. Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS).
        2.AWS Lambda
        3.Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
        4.Amazon CloudWatch:
